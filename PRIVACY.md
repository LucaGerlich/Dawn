# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: 2022-06-01*

Dawn is an Android application licensed under the Apache License 2.0. See [LICENSE](./LICENSE.md) for the full text of this license.

This privacy policy aims to provide information on how Dawn handles your data. This policy may be updated at any time for any reason, and this will be indicated by updating the "last updated" date at the top of the policy.

## Overview

Dawn **doesn't collect any data about you, or your device** and **contains no third party SDKs for adverts, analytics, or telemetry**. It does, however, access third party services such as Reddit, which have their own privacy policies and may collect data. See the "Third Party Services" section below.

## Data Stored on Your Device

When you use Dawn, data including (but not limited to) the following may be stored locally on your device.

- App preferences
- Your logged-in Reddit accounts
- Information downloaded from Reddit about your account, such as subscribed subreddits/users, voting activity, your inbox contents, etc
- A cache of previously visited/read pages
- Cookies from websites viewed in internal browser

## Third Party Services

Dawn is similar to a web browser in that it can be used to access a variety of third party services. These are not operated by the Dawn developers, and therefore you are advised to review the privacy policies of these third party services.

Dawn accesses the Reddit API. This may occur while the app is in use, or periodically in the background to fetch messages and notifications. Reddit is a third party service and outside the scope of this privacy policy. Reddit's privacy policy is available here:

Dawn downloads images and other data from third party websites linked to by Reddit posts and comments. This may occur when you click a link, open a Reddit post or automatically in the background when viewing a post list (if pre-caching is enabled in the preferences). Also, these services may be accessed directly through the original link, or through an API if one is available. Again, the privacy policies of these third party websites are outside the scope of Dawn’s privacy policy.

## App Stores

This policy does not apply to the third party app store(s) from which you obtained Dawn, such as Google Play or F-Droid. Please consult the relevant policies of those third parties.

Google Play provides app developers with various statistics and crash logs. These are collected by Google Play Services, which is not part of Dawn and is outside the scope of this privacy policy.

## Permissions

Dawn may request certain permissions that allow it to access the User's device Data as described below. By default, these permissions must be granted by the User before the respective information can be accessed. Once the permission has been given, it can be revoked by the User at any time.

- **Storage permission**
   - Used to save downloaded media to device’s storage and User’s photo library.

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us using the email listed in the app store.
